J.P. Howard &amp; Company is a management consulting firm focusing on public policy and public administration. We work directly with clients to find solutions to public policy problems. Using quantitative and qualitative analysis to understand underlying problems, we provide best-fit solutions for complex policy questions.

In this work, we rely on R to provide analytical and statistical rigor and are capable of applying that rigor to any field. Services include:
● Data cleaning and analysis,
● Design of experiments,
● Statistical analysis, and
● Social science research.
Other tools we use include SQL databases, MongoDB, CouchDB, LaTeX, and Weka.
