I've re-written this post five times already and haven't been able to get the
tone right so I'll just stick to the facts:

- Donald Trump said as president he would support [Article XII](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-hell-protect-constitutions-article-xii/story?id=40422352) of the constitution
- There is no Article XII of the constitution
- I love my Amazon Echo
- I have been wanting to write a skill for my Amazon Echo (a.k.a. Alexa)
- I wrote an Alexa skill that describes some things Article XII might cover, if it existed
- It is mostly based on [this work](http://www.timcarr.net/?p=372) by Tim Carr
- If you want to submit additional things that Article XII might cover (if it existed) tweet
them at [@bryancshepherd](https://twitter.com/bryancshepherd) hashtag `#whatisarticleXII` or post them in the comments. I will
add them to the next version of the skill if the initial version passes Amazon's
review.
- There is no chance this skill will pass Amazon's review.

The current hypothetical Article XIIs are:
- Article XII mandates that all dogs must be trained to shoot free throws, in
the event that such a skill is required to settle an international dispute.
- Article XII governs the creation, distribution, and taxation of loofahs.
- Article XII states that the harboring of pink, furry, intergalactic lifeforms
shall be prohibited.
- Article XII deems it illegal to carry different denominations of change in the same pocket.
- Article XII describes the process for making dingy whites all nice and sparkly again.
- Article XII requires that cats look all apathetic and nonchalant after doing something dumb.
