You can now subscribe to almost any content on the ProgrammingR website, including the job listings.

To be notified of job listings as soon as they are posted, click the "R Jobs" link above and follow the instructions on that page to add the jobs feed to your feed reader.Because of this change, I will now be reposting jobs from the R Jobs listserv and other sources, so that you only need to subscribe to one service. If you have a source for R Jobs listings that you would like to see represented in the Job Listings section, send me a <a href="http://www.programmingr.com/contact" title = "Contact page">message</a> and I will attempt to include it.

If you would like to submit a job or consultant listing, you can do so via the contact page.
