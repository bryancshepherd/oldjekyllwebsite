In a <a href="http://www.programmingr.com/content/online-r-programming-resources" title="R-programming resources">previous article</a> I provided a list of R programming resources.  As a complement to that post, I've compiled a list of statistically oriented websites that colleagues and I have found useful below.  For the most part, these sites focus on statistics and quantitative research methods rather than programming.

This first grouping lists sites that are mostly one-stop-shops for research design and analytical information.  The first two, (and especially the UCLA website) are Tier I statistics/research methods sites.  They are indispensable.  The three remaining sites in this section cover less advanced topics and focus more on basics, but may be helpful for the R user who is more programmer than statistician.

The second group of sites is comprised of technical references such as statistical dictionaries and notation guides.  The final section list two sites that have detailed information and examples focused on running statistical analyses in R.  Note that the UCLA site also includes many examples using R.
