My name is Bryan. I have a doctorate from the University of Texas at Austin and have been teaching, conducting and consulting in the area of research methods for over a decade. I was taught to do quantitative research using SPSS and SAS (and STATA to some extent). In my professional career I have used those tools and many more, including more general languages such as C++, Python, and Ruby. I do my best to maintain proficiency in many packages and languages, but I have devoted a considerable amount of recent time to R because of its flexibility and power, and because of the potential of open source software. Like any good data scientist, I have some background in web programming and languages. 

This site covers a variety of topics ranging from full-on development projects to short pieces of code and thoughts I don't want to loose. Some of the older articles were originally written for ProgrammingR.com, an R-based website that I founded and mantained until it was sold in the summer of 2015.
